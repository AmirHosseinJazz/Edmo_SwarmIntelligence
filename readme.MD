Discussions and Limitations:
Make more accurate measurements 
Outliers and how they are created- manually deleted => skewness in parameter space - specify the number of outliers
relative importance of speed not the absolute
Discuss the timer intervals and what might happen in case of changing from a good parameter set to a bad one and vice versa
Discuss the surface problem and how it sometimes affect the speed






Discuss why we did sampling and why we couldnt talk about the whole parameter space (time constraints)
Domain knowledge might create a bias in our parameter space (we deleted some points based on our intuition)

Discuss about idea of spilitting space - the effect of splitting on PSO
Clustering technique for splitting space
